About
----------------
Tadpydoodle is a simple GUI-based package for visual stimulus presentation,
designed for neurophysiological experiments. It is written in Python for ease of
scripting and extension, and uses an OpenGL graphical backend for speed.
Currently only Linux is supported.

Required:
	PyOpenGL <= 3.1.0
	numpy <= 1.7.1
	wxPython <= 2.8.12

Useage
----------------
Tadpydoodle can be started from the command line like this:

<tadpydoodle/directory>$ python tadpydoodle.py

Configuration settings will be saved in ~/.tadpydoodle/tadpydoodlerc.

Stimulus design
----------------
Stimuli are Python classes which can be defined in any Python source file within
the tasks/ directory. They must have both "taskname" and "subclass" attributes,
and must implement a "._drawstim()" method. See the contents of the tasks/
directory for examples.
